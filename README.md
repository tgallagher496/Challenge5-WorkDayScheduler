## Description

This project is a calender project where the user can input items into their daily calender.  The calender will color code their day:  gray symbolizes events in the past, red symbolizes the current time and green symbolizes events that are yet to come.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/ReadMePic` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
![ReadMe Image](/assets/ReadMePic.png)
